*Whole-exome Sequencing (WES)* is a major approach to uncovering gene-disease associations and pinpointing effector genes. We developed MAGICpipeline, a convenient and open-access analysis pipeline, to estimate the genetic associations of rare and common variants in large-scale case-control WES studies. Gene-based rare variants association analyses were assessed by incorporating multiple variant pathogenic annotations and statistical methods. The protocol also used Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA), a systems biology method, to identify disease-related modules and hub genes.

**[We also provide a step-by-step tutorial for you to walk through the MAGICpipeline.](https://github.com/sulab-wmu/MAGIC-PIPELINE/blob/main/Magic_pipeline.md)**
